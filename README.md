# [sUNC Documentation](https://docs.sunc.su)

Welcome to the repository for sUNC's online documentation.
Documentation is hosted at <https://docs.sunc.su> and it aims to replace the legacy way of simply documenting via markdown in the [old documentation repository](https://github.com/sUNC-Utilities/Global-Functions-Documentation).

## What is sUNC?
Please view the README about sUNC at [docs/About/what-is-sunc.md)](./docs/About/what-is-sunc.md) or look at the entire ["About" directory](./docs/About/).

## Contributing

Please make a **PULL REQUEST** with your changes so that they can be reviewed.

In general, commits and pushes (or any interaction with the main branch) is disabled for all users, including administrators. This aims to reduce commit conflicts - please use pull requests instead so that changes can be discussed.

<summary>Internally working on the documentation system</summary>


If internally working on the actual documentation **platform** itself (although your changes will be thoroughly reviewed and unfortunately declined), please use a Python Virtual Environment (venv).

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
```
